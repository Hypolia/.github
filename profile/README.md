## Nos Technologies

### Web Application
Our website is separated into several applications, more precisely the API Rest is separate from the Frontend. This allows us a better structuring of our applications and a greater freedom.

**__Backend (API Rest)__**
Our backend is actually an API-Rest under AdonisJS. This one has the particularity to be the data skeleton. Every request goes through it, whether it's for the frontend application, the bot or the minecraft server. So everything is unified and allows a better control. If a modification is made, it will be automatically applied to each application. So we save time, optimization, etc...

We use: [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) and [AdonisJS](https://adonisjs.com/)

**__Frontend__**
Our frontend is the visual part of our site. It includes the main pages, the dashboard, the profiles etc... In order to provide a fast rendering, our frontend application uses several technologies:
 - Framework UI : [WindiCSS](https://windicss.org/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
 - Framework Frontend : [VueJS](https://v3.vuejs.org/) and [NuxtJS](https://nuxtjs.org/)
